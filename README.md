## Installation

1. Install [ROS 2](https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/index.html), [IDS Peak](https://en.ids-imaging.com/files/downloads/ids-peak/readme/ids-peak-linux-readme-2.9.0_EN.html#first-start) and dependencies or use Docker via the launcher.

2. Clone this Python package into your ROS 2 workspace, e.g., `/colcon_ws/src/nimbro_camera_ids`.

3. Run:

    ```bash
    source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash
    colcon build
    ```

## Usage

```bash
source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash
source /colcon_ws/install/setup.bash
ros2 run nimbro_camera_ids spin
```

## TODO

- Setup IR filter
- Check remaining IR artifacts
- Color correction/calibration
- Possibly color conversion and correction in parallel on a GPU?
- Fix focal length with desired object distance and size (see https://en.ids-imaging.com/lensfinder.html)
- Camera config (in ids peak cockpit)
- White balance
- Hot pixel correction
- Auto features
- Gamma correction
- Timestamps: Maybe linescan mode and listen to internal events: https://en.ids-imaging.com/manuals/ids-peak/ids-peak-user-manual/2.8.0/en/event-selector.html?q=events Or estimate from outside: Subtract delay between image acquisition and message creation and calibrate. Rolling shutter would still be a problem.
- IPL library config (number of threads and stuff)
- Use launchfile instead of ros2 run
- Reattach reaction stuff
- Registration of Lidar and camera
- Problem: Framerate drops as the thread is not keeping up with the camera acquisition when there are multiple image topic subscribers. Check camera_info topic for comparison.
- Use launchfile instead of ros2 run
- Intrinsics calibration
- Extrinsics calibration
